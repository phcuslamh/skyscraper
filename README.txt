Everything works.

Notes:
1. The program runs only when the input is entered all in one go 
(for example, the code does NOT read the first line for the dimension, and then prompt the user to enter the subsequent lines one-by-one until they are finished).

2. I also commented out the print() method in the main method, since the problem does not ask us to include it there. 
If you want to run the print() method, please delete the // before it in the main methods.

3. Finally, for the case n >= 10, I formatted the graphical representation differently (depending on the number of digits of the dimension). 
This is why the printFormatted and printHeading methods look overly complicated.
